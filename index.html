    <h6>INGRIDIENTS</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>INSTRUCTIONS</H6>
    <ul>
        <li>Start by mixing the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Add the wet/buttermilk mixture to the dry flour mixture and mix the batter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water into the batter and stir until smooth. The batter will be very thin!</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into your cake pans and bake the cakes on the middle rack of the oven.</li>


        <li>Eggs at room temperature (as opposed to cold from the fridge) are fluffier and will emulsify 
        in the batter better, which will also help the cake rise properly. A trick for bringing eggs 
        to room temperature quickly is to run hot water over them for one minute,or let them sit in a bowl 
        of warm water for 5 minutes.</li>
